## How it started

So , during the desperate times of using mobile internet hotspot to grind my daily internet
workflow , I thought of investing around 1k INR on a JioFI3 which was all the rage back when
it was launched. I was confident that it'll provide me a more constant connection for running
day to day tasks as well as occasional gaming.

## How it turned out

After the initial setup , everything was working fine but the speed was too close to mobile internet
which made me rethink my decision on buying this. I went to the router page for a random inspection , and 
then it struck me.

## The realisation

Going to [localhost][1] page and a little inspection gave away the fact that whenever the device is locked on to
Band 40 , the speeds were excellent. There are a total of 3 bands. Band 3, Band 5 and Band 40. Unfortunately , there is
no manual control alloted to the end-user where we can lock on to a specific band. The trick here is to find the perfect spot in your area where the range light is blue and the band is 40. This will provide you seemless speeds of 
around 10 - 12 mbps where HD streaming and gaming are a breeze.
