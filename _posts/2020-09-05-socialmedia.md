Every living soul that's on planet earth is living a unique life. The thoughts that mold him , the interactions around his world and how he percieve himself , his goals and his surrounding is unique to the core. His rate of success, his life progression and even his death will be unique. This is the universal truth that everyone's trying to forget. 

This idea was challenged since the beginning of time by the human nature of comparison. This is strong now since the arrival of social media and instant communication services. People are live-streaming their success and others are even eager to absorb it. While some make it positive , for others it further turns them down.

People should realise that the glorified version of others or the end picture that they portray is not made up on a single night , or even entirely true. The recommendation algorithms make it worse by matching one to similar echo-chamber connections and groups. Social Media's like Reddit gives a person more freedom to choose his content and morever its more about general information and discussion related to common subjects and not personal shoutouts.

Being content in life is one of the prime qualities one can have. It'll help him sail through the darkest of nights of stress and agony and assures him that he is near to his goal one step at a time as long as he is moving forward. The role of social media and modern influencers should be carefully selected so that they'll push us to train harder than pull us down to the spiral of self pity and depression. Be careful whom you follow @ the online world. Peace !
